During vCenter installation, you will come across the port details wizard page and when you click Next, you will receive an error message similar to the one below:

" The following port numbers are either invalid or already in use. VMware VirtualCenter HTTP Port: 80 "

You can have a look at this KB article here, however, sometimes even though all the conditions in this article are met, you might still receive the above mentioned error.

How do we get past this?

1. Open a command prompt in elevated mode (As administrator) on the machine where you are installing the vCenter Server. Run the below command:
netstat -ano | find "80"
This command tells which process is currently listening on port 80. You will see a Process ID (PID) of 4 which is running on this port blocking the installation of vCenter.
2. Open Task Manager on the same machine. Navigate to Processes tab. Click View and click Select Columns and make sure PID is checked and then select OK
3. Now, if it is a normal application or IIS, disable it or uninstall. If it is a System Process: PID 4 - you need to disable the HTTP.sys driver
4. On the same machine, open regedit (Start > regedit)
5. Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP
6. Change the value of " start " to 4 which means disabled
7. Reboot the machine and perform the installation again.
